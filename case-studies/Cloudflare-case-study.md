## Important events
  ### 2017
  In 2017, Cloudflare got a report on a security problem with their edge servers. In some unusual circumstance, Cloudflare’s edge servers were running past the end of a buffer returning memory that contained private information such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data, and some of that data ha been cached by search engines. 

  Cloudflare quickly identified the problem and turned off three minor Cloudflare features (email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes and Automatic HTTPS Rewrites) that were all using the same HTML parser chain that was causing the leakage. 

  Cloudflare quickly responded to the incident and patched the bug, and worked with its customers to help them mitigate the impact of the leak. Th incident was significant because Cloudflare provides services to a large number of websites, and the leak potentially affected millions of users.

  Cloudflare’s response to the incident was widely praised, and the company took steps to improve its security processes and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

  ### 2019
  In 2019, Cloudflare deployed a new rule in their WAF Managed Rules which caused CPUs to become exhausted on every CPU core that handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic on the Cloudflare network worldwide.

  The update contained a poorly written regular expression that ended up creating excessive backtracking and exhausted CPUs used for HTTP/HTTPS serving, which brought down Cloudflare’s core proxying, CDN and WAF functionality. This results in customers (and also their customers) seeing a 502 error-page when visiting any Cloudflare domain. 
A protection that would have helped prevent excessive CPU used by a regular expression was removed by a mistake during a refactoring of the WAF weeks prior – a refactoring that was supposed to make the WAF use less CPU. The regular expression engine that was used did not have complexity guarantees, and the test suite did not have a way of identifying excessive CPU consumption, which made the SOP** allow a non-emergency rule change to go globally intro production without a staged rollout. The first alert for the global traffic drop took too long to fire, and Cloudflare had difficulty even accessing their own systems because of the outage and the bypass procedure wasn’t well trained on. SREs** had also lost access to some systems because their credentials had been timed out for security reasons, and the customers were also unable to access the Cloudflare Dashboard or API because they pass through the Cloudflare edge. The outage lasted for about an hour and affected a significant number of websites and online services. However, Cloudflare’s quick response and resolution of the issue helped to minimize the impact on its customers.

  To prevent this from happening again, they re-introduced the excessive CPU usage protection that accidently got removed. They manually inspected all (over 3000) rules in the WAF Managed Rules to find and correct any other instances of possible excessive backtracking. Cloudflare introduced performance profiling for all rules to the test suite, switched to Rus Regex Engine which have run-time guarantees and changed the SOP to do staged rollouts of rules in the same manner used for other software at Cloudflare while retaining the ability to do emergency global deployment for active attacks. They also put in place an emergency ability to take the Cloudflare Dashboard and API off Cloudflare’s edge, and, since they were slow to update during this outage, they added automated update of the Cloudflare Status page.

  Overall, Cloudflare takes the reliability and security of its network very seriously in is constantly working to improve its systems and processes to prevent outages and other issues from occurring in the future.
